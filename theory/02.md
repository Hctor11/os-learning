# What kinds of OS are there?

- operating systems are made from a lot of components
- The core component of an os is the _Kernel_
- the non-kernel bits are called _userland_

When we categorize operating system we tend to categorize them by what kinds of kernel they have.

## Monolithic kernels

most real world kernels are monolithic kernels.

If a monolithic kernel were a web app, it would be a big Rails app, with one repo and a million of subdirectories.

## Microkernels

Is when a lot of the functionality is in the userspace, in theroy this is a good idea, but in the practice microkernels have had issues.

If a microkernel were and application it would be a microservice, and a bunch of the other stuff that is in the kernel space in a monolithic kernel are other microservices in the userspace.

## Exokernels and Unikernels

unikernes: only run one program at a time.

exokernels: more micro than microkernels
